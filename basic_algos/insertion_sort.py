# theory (task to solve)
# inserts elements to their correct position from right to left


# pseudocode (design)
# go through the list from right to left
# the most right element is a key
# if key is less than previous element swap key and this element
# keep comparing the key repeatedly until end (start) of the list


# actual code (practice)
