Reverse a String:
    Write a function to reverse the characters in a string.

Palindrome Check:
    Determine whether a given string is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards).

Anagram Check:
    Check if two strings are anagrams of each other.

Count Vowels and Consonants:
    Write a function to count the number of vowels and consonants in a string.

String Compression:
    Compress a string by counting repeated characters. For example, convert "aaabbbbccc" to "a3b4c3".

String Rotation:
    Check if one string is a rotation of another string.

Substring Search:
    Implement a function to check if a substring exists in a given string.

Title Case Conversion:
    Convert a string to title case (capitalize the first letter of each word).

Remove Duplicates:
    Remove duplicate characters from a string.

String to Integer (atoi):
    Implement the atoi function to convert a string to an integer.

Caesar Cipher:
    Implement encryption and decryption functions for a Caesar cipher.

String to URL:
    Replace spaces in a string with '%20' to create a URL-friendly string.

Longest Common Prefix:
    Find the longest common prefix among an array of strings.

Valid Parentheses:
    Check if a given string of parentheses is valid.

String Permutations:
    Generate all possible permutations of characters in a string.

Edit Distance:
    Calculate the minimum number of operations required to convert one string into another (insert, delete, or replace).

Longest Palindromic Substring:
    Find the longest substring that is a palindrome.

Camel Case to Snake Case:
    Convert a CamelCase string to snake_case.

String Zigzag Conversion:
    Convert a string to zigzag pattern given a number of rows.

First Non-Repeating Character:
    Find the first non-repeating character in a string.

Additional:

Is Unique
    Determine if a given string has all unique characters (can't use additional data structures)

Check Permutation
    Given two strings, write a function to decide if one is a permitation of another

URLify
    Write a funciton to replace all spaces with '%20' (shooulde beformed operation in place)

Palindrome Permutaion
    Write a function that would check if a given string is a permutation of a palindrome. (you can ignore non letter characters)

One Way
    There are three types of edits that can be performed on strings: insert a character, remove, or replace a character. Given two strings, write a function that would check if second string is a one (or zero) edit away from the first string.

String compression
    Implement a method to perform a basic string compression using the counts or repeated characters. If after compression your string will not become smaller the algorithm should return original string. Assume that string has upper and lower cases only. e.g. 'aaabbccccd' -> 'a3b2c4d1'
